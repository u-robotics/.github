Micro companions are compact robots designed to entertain and support people in any space, no matter how limited. These robots may not have enough computing power to operate completely independently, so they usually need to be connected to a smartphone or PC/laptop. While they can be used without a connection, their functionality becomes limited. They can also occasionally utilize cloud infrastructure for additional processing capabilities.
