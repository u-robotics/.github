Through Î¼-Robotics, I explore future technological advancements, extending beyond my current work to satisfy my curiosity. I manage this effectively by relying on AI assistants to handle a significant portion of the workload, allowing me to dedicate minimal personal time.

My efforts are concentrated on research and development, specifically in finding practical applications of AI+Robotics that deliver real impact in life and business. My method involves identifying promising new areas and then rigorously building and testing these solutions through experimentation and prototyping.

This project began with the goal of designing compact robots that could entertain and assist people in even the most limited spaces. I soon discovered this ambition demanded a significant amount of new expertise and interdisciplinary work. This led me to pivot, concentrating instead on using AI to accomplish many of these tasks, and evolving the project into my personal R&D in AI, and Robotics.
